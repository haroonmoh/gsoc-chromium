# Haroon's GSOC Chromium Application Code

Hello everyone, this is my GSOC Chromium application code. You can find my code in the src file and the distribution code in the dist folder.

The important files are:
* src/button-clicks.js
* src/index.js
* src/jobs-functions.js
* dist/add/index.html
* dist/update/index.html
* dist/index.html

## Introduction
Today, in tech, there is currently a data privacy revolution happening and with that companies and organizations must adapt to meet future needs of customers. Google being one of these companies has taken a proactive role in this issue and has launched Privacy Sandbox, a multi-party-computation aggregation service. However, the system currently lacks usability and observability. So, during my 12 weeks, I hope to build a control plane tool with GCP, Firebase, and JavaScript that will increase the usability and observability of the Privacy Sandbox.

This is the starter code that I have written in the past week.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Run npm install
3. Use "npm start" to launch a dev server.

## Commands
* npm run build - builds production code
* npm run build-dev - builds dev code
* npm start - launches a dev server
* npm test - run tests
* npm run deploy - runs production build and then deploys to firebase

For "npm run deploy", make sure to set up firebase hosting for your project.
